Through this project our mission is to create environmental, personal and social change through revitalising menstrual practices that are healthy, environmentally sustainable, culturally responsive and empowering.
While the importance of creating awareness about menstrual health and hygiene is indisputable. Our objective is to create awareness sustainable options available.
